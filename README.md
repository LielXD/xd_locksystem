**Exports**<br>

To set owned vehicle keys you can use the exports below.

```lua
exports['xd_locksystem']:SetVehicleKey(plate, remove)
```
* **plate** - the vehicle license plate.

* **remove** - if true then it will remove the key from any player.

```lua
exports['xd_locksystem']:GetVehicleData(plate)
```
* **plate** - the vehicle plate you want to check key for.
<br>

  *this will return 2 values:*

* **keys** - with these values

  * false - no one have keys to the vehicle.

  * true - someone have keys to the vehicle.

  * 'self' - current player have keys to vehicle.

* **lockpick** - with these values

  * false - vehicle have not lockpicked.

  * true - vehicle lockpicked.

  * 'NPC' - used in the script to prevent from players to lockpick npc vehicles driving around.

**Example**<br>
client script:
```lua
RegisterCommand('engine', function()
	local vehicle = GetVehiclePedIsIn(PlayerPedId(), false)
	if vehicle ~= 0 then
		local plate = GetVehicleNumberPlateText(vehicle)
		local VehicleData = exports['xd_locksystem']:GetVehicleData(plate)

		-- make sure here to check if the current player have keys â†“
		if VehicleData.keys == 'self' then
			local engineState = GetIsVehicleEngineRunning(vehicle)
			SetVehicleEngineOn(vehicle, not engineState, false, true)
		end
	end
end)
```
